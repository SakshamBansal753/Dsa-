# 📘 DSA in C++

Hello, my name is **Saksham Bansal** 👋  
This repository is a comprehensive collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** implemented in **C++**. It includes well-structured code examples, problem-solving techniques, and optimized solutions — all aligned to help you master DSA for competitive programming, technical interviews, and academic excellence.

## 📖 Description
I'm **not a teacher or instructor**, just a passionate **student learning DSA in C++**.  
This repository is my personal practice space where I solve problems, implement core concepts, and improve my understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms.  

I created this repo to:
- Track my progress 📈  
- Practice consistently 💻  
- Share my journey with others who are learning like me 🤝  

## 🚀 What You’ll Find Here

- 🔹 Arrays and Strings  
- 🔹 Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)  
- 🔹 Stacks and Queues  
- 🔹 Trees and Binary Trees (BSTs, AVL, etc.)  
- 🔹 Graphs (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, etc.)  
- 🔹 Recursion and Backtracking  
- 🔹 Sorting & Searching Algorithms  
- 🔹 Greedy, Dynamic Programming, and Bit Manipulation  
- 🔹 Sliding Window, Two Pointer, and other Patterns  
- 🔹 LeetCode, GFG, InterviewBit, and Contest Problems
